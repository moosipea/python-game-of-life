# python-game-of-life
simple implementation of John Conway's "Game of life" in python, using the pyxel engine for graphics and input

to run the .py file you need the [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) module installed

pyxel let's you package everything into one .exe and it will even work on a system without python installed

[download the exe](https://github.com/moosipea/python-game-of-life/raw/main/game-of-life.exe)
